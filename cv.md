### About me


I decided to change my professional field and become a front-end developer in January 2023. Since then, I've joined SheCodes community and their coding workshops. Coding captured my attantion from the first lessons. During my learning at SheCodes, I gained skills in Visual Studio Code, CodeSandbox, API, Bootstrap, Git, GitHub, Netlify. 
I joined the Rolling Scopes School in June 26 2023 to gain more fundamental knowlege and new skills.
